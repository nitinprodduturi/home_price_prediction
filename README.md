Data Set:https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data
I, first builded a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
This Project uses the following Technoloy and Tools:
1.Python with Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib and Scikit Learn.
2.Anaconda Distribution.
3.VS code.
4.Pycharm.
5.Python flask for server.
6.HTML/CSS/JavaScript for UserInterface.
